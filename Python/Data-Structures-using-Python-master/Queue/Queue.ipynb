    "* A queue is a data structure used for storing data (similar to Linked Lists and stacks). In queue, the order in which dula arrives is important.\n",
    "* A queue is an ordered list in which insertions are done at one end (rear) and deletions are done at other end (front). The first element to be inserted is the first one to be deleted. Hence, it is called First in First out (FIFO) or Last in Last out (LILO) list.\n",
    "* For example, our labs have 30 computers networked with a single printer. When students want to print, their print tasks “get in line” with all the other printing tasks that are waiting. The first task in is the next to be completed."

    "* Keyboard: As we type, sometimes keystrokes get ahead of the characters that appear on the screen. This is due to the computer doing other work at that moment. The keystrokes are being placed in a queue-like buffer so that they can eventually be displayed on the screen in the proper order."
