# Tuples

# Task 
# Given an integer, n, and n space-separated integers as input, create a tuple, t, of those n integers. Then compute and print the result
# of hash(t).

# Note: hash() is one of the functions in the __builtins__ module, so it need not be imported.

# Input Format
# The first line contains an integer, n, denoting the number of elements in the tuple. 
# The second line contains n space-separated integers describing the elements in tuple t.

# Output Format
# Print the result of hash(t).

# Enter your code here. Read input from STDIN. Print output to STDOUT
tuple_len = int(input())
a = tuple(map(int, input().split(' ')))
print(hash(a))
